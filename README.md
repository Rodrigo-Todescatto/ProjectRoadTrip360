ATTENTION!!!: It was discovered that the project most likely don't work on Xbox 360 because of Ttitle Update compatibility issues and i'm already fixing that issue.




In Progress:

-Bypass "The Forza Horizon 2 servers aren't available at this moment. Try again later." for Online Road Trip


Already made: 

-Clubs (only create)


NOTE: THE PROJECT IS BEING TESTED IN NETPLAY XENIA CANARY SINCE I DON'T HAVE AN MODDED XBOX 360,IF ANYONE CAN TEST IT ON AN XBOX 360 WITH RGH/JTAG I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT WOULD HELP A LOT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT.


HOW TO INSTALL:
-Transform the Forza Horizon 2 GOD file into an ISO file with God2Iso,then extract it and replace the default.xex, gamemodes.zip and the zipmanifest.xml with the ones on the repository. Note that zipmanifest.xml and Gamemode.zip are inside the "media" folder. After that, you will be able to create clubs.(apparently it works, since clubs are on Xbox Live and not really in the Turn 10 servers, but i can't really tell because i tested it on Xenia)


NOTE 2: YOU NEED AN MODDED XBOX 360 WITH RGH/JTAG TO PLAY IT, IT DOESN'T WORK WITH OTHER ANY MODS LIKE LT3.0 OR LTU2.
